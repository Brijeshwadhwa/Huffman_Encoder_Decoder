# 🌐 Huffman Encoder/Decoder

A web-based Huffman Encoder and Decoder built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++. This project allows users to encode and decode text using Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for lossless data compression. The web interface communicates with a backend server (e.g., built with Flask) to perform the encoding and decoding operations in C++.


## 🚀 Features

- 🔣 Encode plain text into Huffman binary string
- 🔁 Decode encoded binary string back to original text
- 📈 Efficient compression via Huffman coding tree
- 💻 C++ backend with fast processing
- 🖼️ Modern, clean UI with a responsive layout
- ✨ C++ code visualized like a code editor for learning reference

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** C++ (integrated via API server like Flask)
- **Visualization:** Styled C++ code section
- **Hosting:** Localhost (Flask or Node.js recommended for backend)
